Explanation:
We define the two classes Convert and Display. The Convert class acts as forwarder to the Display class which takes an additional parameter that specifies whether a base class was already instantiated. The general display class finds the current last digit, converts it to a character, and merges this char with an instantiation of itself with the remaining digits. We define two base classes that end the recursion when there are no more digits. 

1. The first specialization is generated when no instance was previously instantiated (create char '0').
2. The second specialization is generated when an instance was previously instantiated (create no char).
