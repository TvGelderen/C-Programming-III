Explanation:
The code converts any non-negative number to a NTBS during compile time. The code consists of a general templated struct definition and two specialized versions. The general template takes a value of size_t (nr) and an variadic amount of chars. It instantiates the NTBS with a reference to itself with nr=nr/10 (number without the last digit) and chars='0'+nr%10 (the number's last digit in char form). This will decrease the number until it reaches the second specialization (<0, chars...>) where the actual NTBS is defined with all variadic char arguments. The first specialization (<0>) is used for the special case where we don't have any characters and the number is zero. We define the NTBS as "0" in this case.
