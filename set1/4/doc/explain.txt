Our forward function uses a variadic template. It will call fun with the extra params. In main we have some test examples. To show our template works.

We fixed the overloaded fun by calling the forwarder as follows:

forwarder<void(int, int)>(fun,  1, 3);
forwarder<void(Demo &&, Demo &&)>(fun, Demo{"hello"}, Demo{"World"});

This ensures the right version of forwarder is being called.
