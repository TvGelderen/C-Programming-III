Production Rules:
   (precedences (shown between parentheses) were set by %prec;
    are equal to the precedence of the rules' 1st terminal tokens;
    or (if not shown) are equal to the default (max) precedence)

2: input ('\x0a') ->  input line '\x0a' prompt
3: input ('\x0a') ->  input '\x0a'
4: line ('m') ->  'm' DOUBLE
5: line ('s') ->  's' DOUBLE

Grammar States: 

State 0:
10: input_$ ->  . input 
  0:   On input to state 1
  1:   On prompt to state 2
  Reduce by 9: prompt ->  . 


State 1:
10: input_$ -> input  . 
2: input -> input  . line '\x0a' prompt 
3: input -> input  . '\x0a' 
  0:   On line to state 3
  1:   On '\x0a' to state 4
  2:   On 'm' to state 5
  3:   On 's' to state 6
  4:   On DOUBLE to state 7
  5:   On INT to state 8


State 2:
1: input -> prompt  . 
  Reduce by 1: input -> prompt  . 


State 3:
2: input -> input line  . '\x0a' prompt 
  0:   On '\x0a' to state 9


State 4:
3: input -> input '\x0a'  . 
  Reduce by 3: input -> input '\x0a'  . 


State 5:
4: line -> 'm'  . DOUBLE 
  0:   On DOUBLE to state 10


State 6:
5: line -> 's'  . DOUBLE 
  0:   On DOUBLE to state 11


State 7:
6: line -> DOUBLE  . 
8: line -> DOUBLE  . INT 
  0:   On INT to state 12
  Reduce by 6: line -> DOUBLE  . 


State 8:
7: line -> INT  . 
  Reduce by 7: line -> INT  . 


State 9:
2: input -> input line '\x0a'  . prompt 
  0:   On prompt to state 13
  Reduce by 9: prompt ->  . 


State 10:
4: line -> 'm' DOUBLE  . 
  Reduce by 4: line -> 'm' DOUBLE  . 


State 11:
5: line -> 's' DOUBLE  . 
  Reduce by 5: line -> 's' DOUBLE  . 


State 12:
8: line -> DOUBLE INT  . 
  Reduce by 8: line -> DOUBLE INT  . 


State 13:
2: input -> input line '\x0a' prompt  . 
  Reduce by 2: input -> input line '\x0a' prompt  .
