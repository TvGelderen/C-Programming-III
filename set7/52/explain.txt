We added '!' and '=' as seperate tokens. This ensures the scanner will recognize them. Next we added the '^' below multiply but above -. This gives it a higher priority than multiply, but less than -. The rule is simply expr '^' expr. For inequality we used the following rule: expr '!' '=' expr. To determine the priority %prec is used that refers to INEQ. INEQ is positioned above '+' so that it has a lower priority than addition. 


Some testing:

2^3
Result:8                -> power works

6*2^3
Result:48               -> power first!

9^-1
Result:0.111111         -> negate before power

4 + 7 != 12
Result:1                -> they are unequal 

4 + 7 != 11
Result:0                -> they are equal, implying + went before !=
