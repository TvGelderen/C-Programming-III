Purpose of this exercise: learn to use back_inserter with a home-made class

Consider the following class skeleton:


    class Data
    {
        typedef std::vector<std::shared_ptr<std::string>> DataVector;

        DataVector d_data;

        public:
            // declare push_back here
    };


Objects of the class Data store pointer to lines in the vector d_data, and provide a push_back member to fill the object with lines of text.

Implement push_back and show how the copy generic algorithm can be used to fill a Data object with lines read from an istream.

Submit the interface of the class Data, the implementation of push_back and a demo program showing its use in combination with the copy generic algorithm.
