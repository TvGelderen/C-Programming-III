We have two methods to fix this problem. The first one uses a static variable with <void> template. The second method demonstrated here uses a base class global counter. This base class is first constructed by all templates, hence it acts as a global counter. The layout is exactly the same as the regular counter. Since public inheritance is used, we can use its public members. 

Output:

    count:  4
    actual: 3
