What's the result of the expression v1 + v2 + v3 + v4?

    An object of the expression template whose index operator will call the operations on the vectors (in this case only additions) in the appropriate (mathematical) order.

How many index computations will be performed?

    In the graph the numbers represent index computations:

        v1      v2      v3      v4
        |       |       |       |
        +---+---+       |       |
        1   |           |       |
           tmp          |       |
            |           |       |
            +-----+-----+       |
            2     |             |
                 tmp            |
                  |             |
                  +------+------+
                  3      |      4
                        tmp
                         5

    Since the vectors are of size N, there are 5 * N index computations.
