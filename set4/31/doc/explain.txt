What's the result of the expression v1 + v2 + v3 + v4?

    An object of the expression template whose index operator will call the operations on the vectors (in this case only additions) in the appropriate (mathematical) order.

How many index computations will be performed?

    In the graph the numbers represent index computations:

        v1      v2      v3      v4
        |       |       |       |
        +---+---+       |       |
        1   |   2       |       |
           tmp          |       |
            |           |       |
            +-----+-----+       |
                  |     3       |
                 tmp            |
                  |             |
                  +------+------+
                         |      4
                        tmp
                         |
                         5

    This is done for all N elements of the vector, so there are 5 * N index computations.
