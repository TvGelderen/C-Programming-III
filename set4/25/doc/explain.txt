Using a policy, we create the Insertable class, which can be used with any container type and the type(s) it should contain. Insertable inherits publicly from the container class, such that all its members are available. The required constructors are declared along with a constructor using a variadic template for all other cases. No insertion operator needs to be declared as a friend, since all information required for this is publicly available.
